## This submission

This release includes several new features, improvements, and bug fixes:

* **New R APIs** for false nearest neighbours, spatial granger causality, and geographical cross mapping cardinality.
* **New vignettes** covering spatial causality methods, SSR for spatial cross-sections data, and an overview of the package structure.
* **Enhancements** to vignette performance and documentation clarity.
* **Breaking changes**:

  * `lib`/`pred` options now exclude `NA` by default.
  * Internal example datasets have been refined for consistency with updated method interfaces.
  
* **Bug fixes** addressing C++/R index mismatches and matrix input issues.

This is a regular feature update aimed at expanding modeling support for spatial dynamic empirical modeling workflows and improving overall usability and documentation.
