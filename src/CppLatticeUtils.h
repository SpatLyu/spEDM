/**
 * Computes lagged neighborhoods for a given lag number, expanding the neighborhoods iteratively
 * by including neighbors of neighbors up to the specified lag number.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   spNeighbor - A 2D vector representing the spatial neighbors for each spatial unit, where each element is a list of neighbors.
 *   lagNum     - The number of lags to expand the neighborhoods.
 *                A lagNum of 1 means only the immediate neighbors are considered.
 *
 * Returns:
 *   A 2D vector where each element is a list of cumulative neighbor indices for a given spatial unit,
 *   including neighbors up to the specified lagNum. If lagNum is less than 1, an empty vector is returned.
 *
 * Note:
 *   The return value corresponds to the cumulative neighbor indices for the specified lagNum.
 *   The neighborhoods are expanded by including neighbors of neighbors, and duplicates are removed at each step.

/**
 * Generates embeddings for a given vector and neighborhood matrix by computing the mean of neighbor values
 * for each spatial unit, considering both the immediate neighbors and neighbors up to a specified lag number.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   vec         - A vector of values, one for each spatial unit, to be embedded.
 *   nb          - A 2D matrix where each row represents the neighbors of a spatial unit.
 *   E           - The embedding dimension, specifying how many lags to consider in the embeddings.
 *   includeself - A boolean flag indicating whether to include the spatial unit itself in its embedding.
 *
 * Returns:
 *   A 2D vector representing the embeddings for each spatial unit, where each spatial unit has a row in the matrix
 *   corresponding to its embedding values for each lag number. If no valid embedding columns remain after removing
 *   columns containing only NaN values, a filtered matrix is returned.
