/**
 * Computes the Cross Mapping Cardinality (CMC) causal strength score (adjusted based on Python logic).
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   embedding_x: State-space reconstruction (embedded) of the potential cause variable.
 *   embedding_y: State-space reconstruction (embedded) of the potential effect variable.
 *   pred: Prediction index vector (1-based in R, converted to 0-based).
 *   num_neighbors: Number of neighbors used for cross mapping (corresponding to n_neighbor in python package crossmapy).
 *   n_excluded: Number of neighbors excluded from the distance matrix (corresponding to n_excluded in python package crossmapy).
 *   threads: Number of parallel threads.
 *   progressbar: Whether to display a progress bar.
 *
 * Returns:
 *   Normalized CMC causal strength score in the range [0,1].

 * Computes the Intersection Cardinality (IC) causal strength score.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   - embedding_x:   The state-space reconstructed from the potential cause variable.
 *   - embedding_y:   The state-space reconstructed from the potential effect variable.
 *   - pred:          A vector specifying the prediction indices(1-based in R, converted to 0-based in C++).
 *   - num_neighbors: Number of neighbors used for cross-mapping.
 *   - max_neighbors: Maximum number of neighbors usable for IC computation.
 *   - threads:       Number of threads to use for parallel processing.
 *   - progressbar:   If true, display a progress bar during computation.
 *
 * Returns:
 *   - A double representing the IC causal strength score, normalized between [0,1].
