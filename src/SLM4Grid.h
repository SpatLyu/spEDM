/**
 * @brief Simulate a univariate Spatial Logistic Map (SLM) over grid-structured data.
 *
 * This function performs time-stepped simulations of the Spatial Logistic Map
 * over a 2D grid. Each cell evolves based on its own value and the average
 * of its k nearest Queen-adjacent neighbors (excluding NaNs).
 *
 * @param mat                2D grid of initial values (e.g., population densities), row-major.
 * @param k                  Number of neighbors to consider (using Queen adjacency).
 * @param step               Number of simulation time steps to run.
 * @param alpha              Growth/interaction parameter in the logistic update rule.
 * @param escape_threshold   Threshold to treat divergent values as invalid (default: 1e10).
 *
 * @return A 2D vector of simulation results:
 *         Each row corresponds to a spatial unit (flattened from the grid),
 *         and each column to a time step (0 to step).
