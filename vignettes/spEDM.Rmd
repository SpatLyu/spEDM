## Overview

The *spEDM* package is an open-source, computationally efficient toolkit designed to provide a unified API for **Spatial Empirical Dynamic Modeling**. It supports a suite of prediction-based causal inference algorithms, including *spatial granger causality tests*, *spatial state-space reconstruction*, and *geographically convergent cross mapping*.  

To facilitate learning and application, *spEDM* includes three typical spatial cross-sectional datasets along with illustrative use cases for each of the core algorithms.

## Installation

Install the stable version from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=spEDM) with:

```r
install.packages("spEDM", dep = TRUE)
```

Alternatively, you can install the development version from [R-universe](https://stscl.r-universe.dev/spEDM) with:

```r
install.packages("spEDM",
                 repos = c("https://stscl.r-universe.dev",
                           "https://cloud.r-project.org"),
                 dep = TRUE)
```
